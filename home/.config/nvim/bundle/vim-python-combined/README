Combined Python 2/3 for Vim
---------------------------

Fork of the python.vim by Dmitry Vasiliev and Neil Schemenauer.

Features
--------

- Syntax highlighting
- Supports 2.x and 3.x features.
- PEP8 inspired indentation with extra handling.

Installation
------------

If you don't have a preferred installation method, I recommend installing
pathogen.vim, and then simply copy and paste:

   cd ~/.vim/bundle
   git clone git://github.com/mitsuhiko/vim-python-combined.git
